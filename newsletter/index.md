This year saw a few changes for the Plex. We had our first extended downtime while I recovered from some hardware failures (no data loss) and I finally got a true offsite backup deployed to keep the "Syndicated" and "Riley's Favorites" libraries backed up, along with other important documents. I also created my first virtual datacenter using a cluster of Thinkpads rescued from a dumpster by a loyal Plex user which will be used to run the services that keep us online.

A personal milestone was reached as I saved another three old Windows laptops by installing Linux Mint, and showing (non-'techy') people a much better computing experiance without a clunky interface and AI being shoved in your face. If you know someone struggling with old hardware let me know, I can show up with a flash drive and we can show them a better way of living.

I thought I would do something a little different in the Plex update for the end of the year. Rather than share the top charts, I thought I would take the time to look back at the media **I** have consumed to give you a peek at what I am doing behind the scenes.

**Movies**

This year yet again I did not go to the Varsity as much as I wanted to, but did at least attend a few shows with someone other than Nicole (so I am at least branching out socially). If anyone wants to see something and needs someone to go with, hit me up:

- The surprise hit: [Saturday Night](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1580427/)
    - A documentary made by James Franco showing the process of making an episoide of Saturday Night Live
    - SNL is very special to me and seeing an unfiltered
- Best experience at the Varsity: [Point Break](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102685/) - A Science on screen presentation
    - We learned about the math and science behind waves before watching some cool surfer dudes you may know
    - I have to recommend attending this series next year, it was such a great time
- Not a typical watch: [Stop Making Sense](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088178), a Talking Heads concert from 1983
    - This is one I didn't see at The Varsity yet that was probably how it was meant to be seen
- A re-watch from my childhood that still hits: [The Benchwarmers](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0437863)
    - I may have been under the influence during this viewing but I still think the story-line is absolutely bonkers and the Fernando Sucre scene still gets me all these years later
- What didn't hit: [The Fantastic Four: First Steps](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10676052/)
  - While not a marvel superfan by any means, I had high hopes for this, but I really felt indifferent about it
  - Nicole and I did re-watch the 2005 version which is better in my opinion

**TV**

I am officially anti-binge as I really find watching shows weekly is a better experience if you can make the time for it:

- An old series I watched for the first time: [Law & Order](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098844)
    - I now watch an episode before bed every night, a huge SVU fan in high school this still scratches that itch while reminding me of simpler times without modern technology
- Worth the effort: [Slow Horses](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5875444)
    - An effort for me, I only allowed myself to watch this if I was on the exercise bike, very sweaty but worth the ride
- The staple: [Survivor](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0239195)
    - Not really much to say here, I am excited for season 50 but really just hoping for any sort of behind the scenes stuff about how they make the show
    - In the off-season this year we watched "David vs Goliath" which was an amazing group and I am excited to see some people back next season


**Podcasts**

The following are the podcasts I have listened to religiously this year, none of which are new to 2025 but have just cemented themselves as the things I depend on every week:

- To stay informed: [News Now](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/500005/npr-news-now) and [Up First](https://www.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first) by NPR
    - I listen to these while I shower on the weekdays, on the weekends I prefer to be alone with my thoughts
- The baseline: [Links with Friends](https://www.youtube.com/@Level1LinksWithFriends)
    - Just a few friends who work together in rural Kentucky go over interesting (mostly tech) news from the week. I usually listen to this only while running so I have been behind since it has gotten cold out.
- My Hero Returns: [Weekly Show](https://www.youtube.com/@WeeklyShowPodcast)
    - Since Jon left Apple TV he has moved his podcast under the Daily Show Branding. Guests are always tangentially related to the topic he covers in his Monday slot on the show (also a must watch).

**Music**

I tend to be quite obsessive with my music, finding myself just going back to my library and listening to albums I have already heard dozens of times. While not a bad thing I do feel like I don't get to explore much. I am always up for a good album recommendation and have received several this year that "totally slapped":

- Best new album: Based purely on listen count [Burnout Days](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nxexeWD-rJwBh7jM5OmgXovKe7_eGVvxs) by Flipturn (which I mentioned in my last email) was probably my favorite out this year
    - A close runner up would be [Son Of Spergy](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nm5srnW-DjmhTCI37UTwNR__wcx0pptAQ) by Daniel Caesar
- Best new (to me) album: [The Gutter](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ky2ZKvzSIVv0OXYZNhd3c2-N-9Gdy7efc) by ALEX SUCKS is something YT recommended to me that has become a staple
- Best experience (excluding the Hinterland debacle): I did something new this year and went to a concert alone (rode my bike to Val Air) and saw Saint Motel
    - Wallows at Vibrant would be runner up

This year was busy yet again, and I want to thank everyone reading this for all the good times spent just hanging out or going on adventures. I feel I have truly made a change in the way I look at what brings life value, and it really is just spending time with the people you care about. I will leave you with some photos representing all the little things that made this year a great one:

First off, lots of coffee:

Growing my datacenter, and plant children:

Or hardly working:
